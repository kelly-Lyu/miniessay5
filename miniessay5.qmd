The decline in response rates across various data collection methods poses a significant challenge in survey research, particularly in assessing and addressing nonresponse bias. The Special Virtual Issue on Nonresponse Rates and Nonresponse Adjustments, published by the Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology editors Kristen Olson and Katherine Jenny Thompson, highlights the importance of choosing appropriate auxiliary variables to mitigate this issue [@oupSpecialVirtual]. By concentrating on auxiliary variables that predict both nonresponse and are closely related to crucial survey results, this collection spotlights strategies to improve survey accuracy and representativeness. The following passage seeks to encapsulate the nature of these discussions, accentuating the role of auxiliary variables in improving the reliability of survey research amidst changing response dynamics.

To effectively assess nonresponse bias and refine adjustment techniques, it is necessary to identify auxiliary variables that can predict nonresponse and correlate with crucial survey outcomes. Rubin showed that variables related to survey efforts, including data collection processes or para data, significantly impact participation [@rubin2018multiple]. However, the weights generated from these variables often have minimal impact on the accuracy of survey estimates.

On the other hand, research by Amaya and Harring [@Ekman2012PoliticalPA], as well as Peytchev, Presser, and Zhang [@lerner2014development], has revealed that civic engagement indicators, such as volunteering and voting history, are linked to higher participation rates in both longitudinal and cross-sectional surveys. These findings indicate that including civic engagement questions within surveys can improve the effectiveness of nonresponse adjustments, irrespective of their direct relevance to the main survey objectives.

Several hurdles persist as the significance of auxiliary variables for adjusting nonresponse bias gains wider acknowledgment. For instance, gathering and analyzing data pertaining to civic engagement demands extra resources and time. Moreover, finding a dependable set of auxiliary variables suitable for every survey can prove hard. Problems concerning the privacy of respondents and the potential revelation of sensitive information also need to be handled.

Despite these obstacles, including civic engagement-related survey questions could produce valuable insights, aiding in refining nonresponse adjustment techniques and improving survey estimate precision. Consequently, pursuing innovative strategies and tools to navigate these issues is vital, aiming to improve the accuracy and dependability of survey results.

Turning to Identifying auxiliary variables offers several benefits in addressing nonresponse bias. Firstly, it enables the evaluation of the potential for nonresponse bias by identifying and understanding the characteristics of nonrespondents compared to respondents. Researchers can attain profound insights into the distinctions and similarities between the two groups by containing auxiliary variables in data collection.

Secondly, the strategic use of auxiliary variables plays a pivotal role in the phase following data collection, particularly in the application of weighting and imputation techniques. These techniques are crucial for adjusting the collected data, ensuring the final analysis is as accurate and representative as possible. By incorporating auxiliary variables that have demonstrated predictive power regarding nonresponse, researchers can conduct a more nuanced and precise evaluation of nonresponse bias. This process often involves carefully modifying the survey data by applying weights, which are meticulously derived from these auxiliary variables. Such a methodical approach allows for a significant enhancement in the sample's representativeness. Consequently, this not only reduces the bias present within the survey estimates but also contributes to the overall reliability and validity of the research findings.

Hsu and Lin [@991427] underline the significance of incorporating auxiliary variables in data collection interventions to reduce the variation in response propensities. Their findings suggest that addressing the imbalance in auxiliary variables during data collection and post-survey adjustments can generate more precise results than using either approach alone.

Accurately identifying and strategically utilizing appropriate auxiliary variables are pivotal in mitigating nonresponse bias within survey research. An extensive body of literature robustly advocates for integrating auxiliary variables, particularly those encapsulating aspects of civic engagement such as volunteering activities and historical voting behaviors, citing them as potent predictors of individuals' likelihood to participate in surveys. Including these variables not only in the initial design but also in the subsequent post-survey adjustments and within the framework of innovative data collection methodologies has significantly enhanced the accuracy and reliability of survey estimates.

Researchers in the field of survey statistics and methodology should resume exploring the effectiveness of these methods across diverse survey contexts and populations. By actively managing nonresponse bias through identifying and utilizing appropriate auxiliary variables, researchers can guarantee the validity and reliability of survey findings.
